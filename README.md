## ðŸ“Œ About This Project
A simple time-based greeting script built with Python, using the `time` module to determine the current hour and greet the user accordingly. Created as a beginner exercise in April 2025.

## Why I Built This
- To understand how to work with the `time` module.
- To learn conditional statements based on time ranges.
- To practice formatting and displaying time in Python.

---

## ðŸš€ What It Does
The program:
- Greets the user based on the time of day:
  - Early Morning (12:00 AM - 4:59 AM)
  - Morning (5:00 AM - 11:59 AM)
  - Afternoon (12:00 PM - 3:59 PM)
  - Evening (4:00 PM - 6:59 PM)
  - Night (7:00 PM - 11:59 PM)
- Displays the current time in the format `HH:MM:SS`.

---

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Working with the `time` module in Python (`strftime`).
- Using conditional statements for time-based outputs.
- Formatting time in a readable way.
- Basic flow control in Python.

---

## ðŸ”„ Updates
- âœ… Created a time-based greeting based on system time.
- âœ… Added formatted time output (hour, minute, second).

---

## Known Issues
- Logic error: `hour <= 24` includes 24:00 (midnight) as "Night," should be `< 24`.
- No error handling for invalid time scenarios.
- No user interaction (static output).

## Development Notes
- Uses basic Python (`time` module, conditionals).
- Current skill level: Beginner (~2/10), growing with each project.
- Next Steps: Add functions, improve logic, enhance interactivity.
